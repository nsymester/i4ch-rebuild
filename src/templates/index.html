    <h2>What is Excess Insurance?</h2>

    <p>
      Car hire companies often charge an excess for damage caused to the car
      whilst you're behind the wheel even if it's not your fault. This can be
      upwards of £1000, meaning that if you're involved in an accident, you'll
      have to pay a contribution to cover the damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      With an annual car hire insurance policy from insurance4carhire, you're
      able to reclaim the excess you’d have to pay in the unfortunate event of
      an accident or your car being stolen.

    <h2>What do we cover?</h2>

    <ul class="std-list">
      <li>Drivers between the ages of 18 and 85</li>
      <li>
        Drivers who are residents of*:<br />France, Germany, Ireland, Italy,
        Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, UK
      </li>
      <li>Trips up to 60 days in-a-row</li>
      <li>
        As well as excess cover, we also offer Collision Damage Waiver (CDW) and
        Supplemental Liability Insurance (SLI). Altough many car rental
        companies automatically include these covers in their car rental
        insurance, some don’t - so it’s important to chek the terms of your car
        rental agreement.
