      <h2>What is Excess Insurance?</h2>

      <p>
        Car hire companies often charge an excess for damage caused to the car
        whilst you're behind the wheel even if it's not your fault. This can be
        upwards of £1000, meaning that if you're involved in an accident, you'll
        have to pay a contribution to cover the damage.
      </p>
      <p>
        With an annual car hire insurance policy from insurance4carhire, you're
        able to reclaim the excess you’d have to pay in the unfortunate event of
        an accident or your car being stolen.

      <ul class="std-list">
        <li>Drivers between the ages of 18 and 85</li>
        <li>
          Drivers who are residents of*:<br />France, Germany, Ireland, Italy,

          As well as excess cover, we also offer Collision Damage Waiver (CDW)
          and Supplemental Liability Insurance (SLI). Altough many car rental
          companies automatically include these covers in their car rental
          insurance, some don’t - so it’s important to chek the terms of your
          car rental agreement.
