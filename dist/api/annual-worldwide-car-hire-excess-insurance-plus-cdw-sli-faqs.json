    "question": "What is Annual Worldwide Plus CDW & SLI cover?",
    "answer": "<p>Annual Worldwide Plus CDW & SLI is a policy which covers your car hire excess, in addition to providing Collision Damage Waiver (CDW) and Supplemental Liability Insurance (SLI). If you’re hiring a car abroad (mainly US or Canada), you may need additional CDW and SLI coverage – it’s best to check your rental insurance to see if this is covered. If it isn’t, our Annual Worldwide Plus policy can provide this.</p>"

    "question": "What is SLI/ALI?",
    "answer": "<p>Supplemental Liability Insurance (SLI), also known as Accident Liability Insurance (ALI), provides cover in the case that you injure other drivers or their vehicles. This tends to come as standard with car rentals in Europe, but in countries such as the USA and Canada, it often isn't included in your car rental. Our policy offers SLI for customers driving in USA, Canada, the Caribbean, Mexico, South and Central America only.</p>"

    "question": "Do car rentals include insurance?",
    "answer": "<p>All car rentals include some insurance as standard, with an excess to pay towards car repair or replacement costs, should you need to make a claim. Car hire excess insurance will cover you against this cost. However, in some countries such as the USA and Canada, Collision Damage Waiver (CDW), which is often included as standard in Europe, is not included, meaning that if you were to damage the car, you would be liable for the full cost of repairing or replacing it. Our Annual Worldwide Plus CDW & SLI policy combines excess insurance, CDW and SLI in one policy.</p>"
