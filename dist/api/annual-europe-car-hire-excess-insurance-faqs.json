    "question": "Do I need to take out car hire excess insurance?",
    "answer": "<p>Car hire excess insurance is not a legal requirement. However, car hire companies typically include fairly high excesses on their rental insurance policies (often between £500 and £2000), so many customers opt to purchase third-party car hire excess cover (such as an insurance4carhire policy) or car hire excess insurance at the rental desk, which will often come at a higher price.</p>"
