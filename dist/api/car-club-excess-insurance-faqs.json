    "question": "Do I need car club insurance?",
    "answer": "<p>Your car club will offer some level of insurance cover as standard, but there is likely to be a high excess (meaning that should you need to make a claim, you'll be liable to pay some amount towards it). Car club excess cover from insurance4carhire will cover this amount, so that should you make a claim, you'll be reimbursed for this excess.</p>"
