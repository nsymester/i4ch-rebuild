                "question": "What is an excess/deductible?",
                "answer": "<p> The excess, known as a deductible in some countries, is the amount you are liable to pay to the car rental company should you have an accident or return the car damaged. When you hire a car, even if your rental agreement includes insurance, there will almost certainly be an excess to pay. Buying excess insurance from us means that if you are asked to pay an excess by your car or van hire company, we'll reimburse you provided it’s covered by the policy. Full details of what is and isn’t covered can be found in the policy wording. </p> <p> Many of our customers ask us to clarify what exactly an excess/deductible is. It is a fixed amount that the insured is liable to pay in the event of a claim. For example, let’s say your car gets damaged which costs £2,000 for repair, and you have a deductible of £500. You would be liable for the first £500 of the claim, and the car rental companies insurance would cover the remaining £1,500. </p> <p> An excess/deductible for your rental car can vary and will be dependent on the vehicle you’re hiring. Deductibles can typically range from £500 up to £1,500*, even for a small prang. If you decline the car rental company’s excess insurance, you may be required to leave a deposit on your Credit Card equal to the amount of excess you’ll be liable for.</p><p>In the event of damage or theft, the excess/deductible will be charged to that card. If you hold an insurance4carhire policy, you’ll be able to claim this back. Just be sure to check our terms and conditions to see whether it’s covered. </p><p>*Based on findings for quotes with Budget, Hertz, Avis, Firefly, Goldcar, Dollar and Sixt in May 2019.</p>"

                "question": "Must I take out excess insurance?",
                "answer": "<p>No, excess is a voluntary insurance. You have three options:</p><ol><li><strong>Choose not to purchase</strong>. If you do subsequently damage the vehicle or if it is stolen, you will be liable for the excess charge.</li><li><strong>You can purchase it from the car rental company</strong>, at the counter when you collect the car, but the costs can be quite high. It generally excludes: damage to the undercarriage, windows, roof and tyres, the parts of the car which are most likely to get damaged should you have accident.</li><li><strong>You can purchase a policy from insurance4carhire</strong>. Our wide range of policies are cheaper than over the counter car hire company excess cover. Plus, in addition to the car hire excess, our policies cover damage to the roof, windows, tyres and undercarriage, something most car hire companies don’t cover.</li></ol>"

                "question": "What is excess reimbursement insurance and how does it work?",
                "answer": "<p>Many people are often confused as to what excess reimbursement insurance actually is. Does it cover the full insurance of the vehicle for example? Or is it covering Collision Damage Waiver?</p><p>Excess insurance is designed to reimburse excess charges imposed by the car rental company, following damage or theft of the vehicle. Say your excess for your car rental were 700 EUR; your vehicle got damaged and the cost of repair were 1,000 EUR. In this instance, you would pay your excess of 700 EUR to the car rental company and the car rental company’s insurance would cover the rest. You’d then need to collate documentation to support and submit your claim.</p><p>You may find that car rental companies do not provide cover for damage to the windows, headlights, roof, tyres and undercarriage. This means that you may be left liable for the full cost of these. But don’t worry, your insurance4carhire policy will cover you for them. Just be aware that we don't provide cover for any accidental damage you may have to the interior of the vehicle.</p>"

                "question": "What is van hire excess insurance?",
                "answer": "<p>When you hire a van, your van rental company will include insurance cover for the duration of the rental period. However, this cover will typically include a large excess should an accident occur. For vans, this excess limit can be thousands of pounds. For this reason, you will usually be offered excess cover when you arrive at the rental desk to pick up your van.</p><p>Our daily van hire excess policy can be purchased up to a year in advance, so that you may be reimbursed your excess should your rental van be damaged or stolen during the rental period.

                "answer": "<p><p>First of all, you’ll need to have a driving licence and for most car rental firms, you need to be over the age of 25. In some cases, if you’re under the age of 25, a ‘young driver fee’ may apply which can cost more.</p><p>The lead driver will also need a credit card for the rental company to put a ‘hold’ or a ‘block’ on; equal to the amount of excess you’ll be liable for. Most car rental firms will not accept Debit Cards, and will not accept anybody else’s Credit Card.</p><p>You may want to consider covering your excess with insurance4carhire. In the event that you’re charged your excess for damage or theft, you’ll be able to claim this back – just make sure you check our terms and conditions to see whether it’s covered.</p><p>Another tip is to check the fuelling policy!</p>"

                "answer": "<p>A ‘Collision Damage Waiver', sometimes referred to as Collision Damage Cover or Loss Damage Waiver (LDW) is a basic insurance cover which covers the rental vehicle against damage and theft.</p><p>Not all car rental companies will include Collision Damage Waiver when you hire a car, so it’s always worth checking ‘what’s included’ before you hire. Without this, you may be left liable for the full cost of the vehicle.</p><p>Collision Damage Waiver is often subject to an excess, which can range between 500 EUR and 1,500 EUR*. Your insurance4carhire policy is designed to cover the excess you are liable for. It will also include damage to the windows, tyres, undercarriage, roof and headlights which may be excluded from the car rental company’s insurance.

                "question": "How much is Collision Damage Waiver (CDW) insurance?",
                "answer": "<p>Each rental company will operate in their own way, and charges will vary. Some rental companies will include CDW as standard, and some will not.</p><p>If you are visiting Canada,the Caribbean, Central America, South America or the USA, then CDW insurance doesn’t always come as standard. For this reason it's worth checking before you get to the car rental desk to avoid any unexpected charges.</p><p>In the case that Collision Damage Waiver is not provided to you by the rental company, we can offer it to you under our <a href=\"/products/annual-worldwide-car-hire-excess-insurance-plus-cdw-sli\"> Annual Worldwide Plus CDW & SLI policy</a>. For anywhere else in the World, it normally comes included but in some cases you may have to pay extra. So check before you buy!</p><p>Tip: If you're booking your car hire through a US site rather than a UK site, you will likely find that CDW and SLI are not covered.</p>"

                "answer": "<p>SLI (Supplemental Liability Insurance), also known as ALI (Additional Liability Insurance) is a form of insurance that protects you (the driver) and your passengers against large third-party claims. Should you have an accident and this results in third-party claims for damages or injuries, then the car rental policy will protect you (the driver).</p>"

                "answer": "<p>The answer is yes. Even if you have pre-paid your car hire in full in the UK you will need a credit card when collecting your vehicle. This is for deposit purposes and should have sufficient credit on it to cover the excess. If you don’t have a credit card you should inform your car rental company, as they could refuse to rent you a car at the car rental desk.</p>"

                "answer": "<p>It’s not a legal requirement to have insurance for your vehicle in America. However, it is compulsory to have a minimum level of cover for third-party insurance. For example, in California the minimum requirement for individual bodily injury is $15,000 whereas it’s only $5,000 for property damage. The minimum can vary from state to state.</p><p>In the UK, the minimum requirement for car insurance is third-party cover which tends to provide cover for millions of pounds.</p><p>You can top up your third-party insurance with our Annual Worldwide Plus CDW & SLI policy which, in addition to car hire excess cover, will cover you for Supplemental Liability Insurance and for Collision Damage Waiver, for damage and theft of the rental vehicle.</p>"
