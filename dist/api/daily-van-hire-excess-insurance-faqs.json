    "question": "How does van hire excess insurance work?",
    "answer": "<p><span>If you have purchased our van hire excess policy from insurance4carhire, decline the van rental company’s excess cover at the counter when you collect the van. Please note that you will need to ensure your credit card has enough credit to cover the full excess amount at the time of collecting the van, as the rental company may reserve the funds on your card even if you are not charged. </span></p> <p><span>If the van is damaged or stolen, the van rental company will charge your credit card for the excess amount. You can then claim for a full reimbursement (subject to any limits) of the excess through insurance4carhire. </span></p>"
